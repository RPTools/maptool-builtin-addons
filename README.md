# maptool-builtin-addons
This repository contains the built in add-on libraries that will be included in MapTool when it is built.

To add a new library (after discussing the need/justification) create a new pull request with your add on library in its own subdirectory.

These built in libraries only support a subset of features, at this time they do not support
* Events (including onFirstInit, onInit)
* A JavaScript Context
